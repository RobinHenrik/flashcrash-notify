## Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Create a `.env` file in the project root directory** (do **not** commit this file to GitHub as it contains sensitive credentials):

    ```
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
    TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID=your_group_or_chat_id
    ```

    - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token from BotFather  
    - `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`: The chat ID or group ID where you want alerts sent

3. **Run the notifier:**
    ```bash
